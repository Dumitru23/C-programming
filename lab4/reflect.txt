1. I like to use arrays. It was easier for me to find max_elem and min_elem than in previously problem N-3. 
It is easy to initialize elements just using one loop instructions for. Also it's easy to output elements, 
as well to work with some specific elements from the array. 

2. Parallel arrays has some advantages. It's easier to understand and use. 
Parallel array is easier to use than other type as record (struct). 
Also I think that they can save some amount of memory in a specific solved problem. 
The disadvantages of parallel array are following: 
We should know in advance the number of elements stored in array. 
Both arrays should have identic size. You can't make a loop using different size of 2 arrays. 
The program might occur and problem will not run or will output unexpected errors. 
Arrays has a fixed size, so the memory once allocated is wasted. (if we compare with dynamic memory) 
Parallel arrays are used just in a specific problems. (Narrow usage). 

3. Initializing with zero is a common practice, because at the begging element of array have randomly value.
Using elements of array later in simple or difficult operation might bring unexpected results 
(semantic mistakes and syntactic ones too).
Also in case we didn’t initialize the whole array, we can output and see where and what was our mistake.
