------------Advantages ousing array of struct-----------------------

*First of all array of structure can hold different data types (var of int, float, double, char, and arrays)
which are grouped together. Parallel Arrays structure don't have this type of option to hold 
a collection of structure together. We used in the program just one type of datatype, 
but work with different information.

* The Employee struct is declared in the file emp_athome.c  with program I created. 
But I could also created in a separate file (struct.h) and just mention in the header (in the emp_athome file with name I created). 
There are some advantages creating separately this file. One of that is that we can use for other programs in C or C++.
 Other one is changing one file doesn’t affect main file.  And for some security purpose too.
