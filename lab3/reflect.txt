1) 	Pseudo-code helped me to follow the steps in order to make up a nice and understandable coding in C. 
	Sometimes I used flow-charts. This one helps me to build a correct algorithm. 
	Even if I have small coding issues, I fix them by detecting errors after debugging.
 
2) 	 I used FOR because it's easy for me to use all in one (initaization, cond, change). It looks compact.   
	And the second was a WHILE, because it was easier for me to write a long logic expression. 
	At the same time I needed to check the high temperature value (var high) and low temperature (var low). 

3) 	It was difficult for me to retain value of heist temperature. (to create the correct algorithm forheist temperature and low as well)
